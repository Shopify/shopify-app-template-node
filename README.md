[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Shopify/shopify-app-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Shopify/shopify-app-node)

Boilerplate to create an embedded Shopify app made with Node, [Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react), and [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/tools/app-bridge/react-components).

## Installation

Using the [Shopify-App-CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-cli) run:

```sh
~/ $ shopify node create -n APP_NAME
```

Or, fork and clone repo

## Requirements

- If you don’t have one, [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup).
- If you don’t have one, [create a Development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) where you can install and test your app.
- In the Partner dashboard, [create a new app](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/tools/partner-dashboard/your-apps#create-a-new-app). You’ll need this app’s API credentials during the setup process.

## Usage

This repository is used by [Shopify-App-CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-cli) as a scaffold for Node apps. You can clone or fork it yourself, but it’s faster and easier to use Shopify App CLI, which handles additional routine development tasks for you.

## Update history

### January 2022: Remove Next.js and Replace Koa with Express.js

We are now using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework to keep Shopify's framework usage consistent.

Our sample app previously used both Koa and Next.js, which made the server-side unnecessarily complex. Initally we removed Next.js so Koa was our only framework, but now we are replacing Koa with Express. Since Next.js was what included webpack in the project, we had to add webpack as a direct dependency so we could continue to build the client React app.
